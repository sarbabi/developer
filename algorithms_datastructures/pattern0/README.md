## pattern 0: iterative traveral on trees
Here presented a pattern related to trees and 3 different problems that can be solved with that pattern.
Solving tree problems, recursive coding is always concise and beautiful, but iterative implementation allows us to understand what's going on

### problem1: iterative inorder traversal of binary tree
look at the file inorder.py to see the implementation
